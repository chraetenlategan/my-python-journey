# my-python-journey
In this repository, I upload my Python programs to document and showcase my learning journey as I build and improve my skills over time.

- [Randomize integers](Randomize-integers)


- Built a custom random number function that generates values within given parameters.  
  This already exists in Python, but I made my own for fun.
